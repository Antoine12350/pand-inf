                <h2>Marburg Virus Disease</h2>
                <p>
                    Marburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe and often fatal illness caused by the Marburg virus, a close relative of the Ebola virus. 
                    It is highly infectious and primarily affects humans and non-human primates. The Marburg virus can spread through contact with 
                    bodily fluids, contaminated surfaces, or objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initial outbreaks of Marburg occurred in Germany and Serbia in 1967, linked to laboratory exposure to infected monkeys. 
                    Since then, several African countries have reported cases, often related to exposure to caves or mines inhabited by Rousettus bats, the natural host.

            <h3>Symptoms and Transmission</h3>
            <p>
                Symptoms of Marburg virus disease typically appear between 2 to 21 days after exposure and include high fever, severe headache, 
                muscle aches, vomiting, and diarrhea. Advanced symptoms can include bleeding from multiple areas, leading to shock, organ failure, 
                and death in severe cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                Marburg is transmitted through direct contact with blood, secretions, and other bodily fluids, as well as contaminated materials. 
                Healthcare settings lacking appropriate protective equipment are particularly at risk of spreading the virus.
